--- v1.0.0 (8/17/2020) ---
Several minor updates:
* Removed player edit on many macros, including all 4 of the campaign macros to stop errors coming from players using 
	the tools.  If you get any errors with players using the "Get Token States" macro, you'll want to make sure that
	all of the macros in the chain have "edit by player" turned off.  If anything returns a "can't do that" to you
	please file an issue on GitHub for it.

* New API: showSpellInfo - Supports MonsterCreator and other outside Drop-Ins that want to hook spell effects and 
	open the spell in the Spell Lookup window.
	
* New ICON for issSpellStates - *shrug* Sure, it's an update right? :)

This is the first actual release of the software.  Please file any bugs / requests with Issues on GitHub.


--- v0.9.7-RC2 (6/20/2020) ---
Updates to the following:
* Overloaded APIs to allow no inputs (uses getSelected()), or to allow Token IDs to be passed to the API Functions.
	This allows frameworks now to either run API macros on selected tokens, or to ignore selected tokens and have 
	the apis run on input Token IDs.
	
* New API: isConcentrationEffect - Returns the "Concentration" flag from the table for the passed in Spell/Effect

* Updated Camapaign Base Properties for issSpelStates to prepend "iss" to the front of them (issSpellBuffs and 
	issSpellDebuffs now instead of spellBuffs and spellDebuffs).  This helps ensure no conflicts between existing
	campaign properites and those I need for issSpellStates to work.
	
* Updated all Campaign States to consistent state groups for 5e campaign States.  Player Handbook states are now in
	the "Conditions" category.  Additional states such as Raging and Inspiration which are part of the game but not
	listed under official "conditions" are now tagged with the "Extended" category.  Finally, generic effects like
	buffed, debuffed, resistance, and immunity are now in the "General" category.
	
* Created a new 5e Campaign States Macros Export file.  This file contains all of the reworked states buttons from 
	the original "Melek's Simple 5e" D&D 5th Edition Framework, plus all additions needed for issSpellStates. These
	macros are updated for button color and consistent output among all of them.
	
* Moved 5e spell table and 5e campaign state macors into their respective 5e directory.  The repository now contains
	a directory for D&D 5th Edition (5e) so that other RPG Platforms can be stored alongside the 5e stuff for
	issSpellStates.  Documentation updated to reflect this.
	
* Updated mtcode file to reflect current code set.

* Significant updates to Documentation (README.MD, User_Manual.txt, Using_issSpellStates_by_Example.txt).

* Added Meleks_Simple_5e_v2.1_SpellStates.cmpgn.zip and S5e2.1_BoT_Spell_Mnstr_States.cmpgn.zip files to the Archive
	to help new campaigns get started with all the Simple 5e tools and my SpellStates stuff quickly.
	
* Added the Rogue Ronan state icons zip file to the release files as well so that people can get ahold of the
	new icons if needed to get their own campaign updated with state icons.

* Token Version Update to v0.9.7-RC2.
